NATIONAL GOALS OF EDUCATION

Education in Kenya should:

Foster nationalism and patriotism and promote national unity

Kenya’s people belong to different communities, races and religions, but these differences need not divide them. They must be able to live and interact as Kenyans. It is a paramount duty of education to help young people acquire this sense of nationhood by removing conflicts and promoting positive attitudes of mutual respect which enable them to live together in harmony and foster patriotism in order to make a positive contribution to the life of the nation.

Promote the social, economic, technological and industrial needs for national development

Education should prepare the youth of the country to play an effective and productive role in the life of the nation.

Social Needs

Education in Kenya must prepare children for changes in attitudes and relationships which are necessary for the smooth progress of a rapidly developing modern economy. There is bound to be a silent social revolution following in the wake of rapid modernization. Education should assist our youth to adapt to this change.

Economic Needs

Education in Kenya should produce citizens with the skills, knowledge, expertise and personal qualities that are required to support a growing economy. Kenya is building up a modern and independent economy which is in need of an adequate and relevant domestic workforce.

Technological and Industrial Needs

Education in Kenya should provide learners with the necessary skills and attitudes for industrial development. Kenya recognizes the rapid industrial and technological changes taking place, especially in the developed world. We can only be part of this development if our education system is deliberately focused on the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will prepare our young people for these changing global trends.

Promote individual development and self-fulfilment

Education should provide opportunities for the fullest development of individual talents and personality. It should help children to develop their potential interests and abilities. A vital aspect of individual development is the building of character.

Promote sound moral and religious values

Education should provide for the development of knowledge, skills and attitudes that will enhance the acquisition of sound moral values and help children to grow up into self-disciplined, self-reliant and integrated citizens.

Promote social equity and responsibility

Education respect should promote social equality and foster a sense of social responsibility within an education system which provides equal educational opportunities for all. It should give all children varied and challenging opportunities for collective activities and corporate social service irrespective of gender, ability or geographical environment.

Promote for and development of Kenya’s rich and varied cultures

Education should instill in the youth of Kenya an understanding of past and present cultures and their valid place in contemporary society. Children should be able to blend the best of traditional values with the changing requirements that must follow rapid development in order to build a stable and modern society.

Promote international consciousness and foster positive attitudes towards other nations

Kenya is part of the international community. It is part of the complicated and interdependent network of peoples and nations. Education should therefore lead the youth of the country to accept membership of this international community with all the obligations and responsibilities, rights and benefits that this membership entails.

Promote positive attitudes towards good health and environmental protection

Education should inculcate in young people the value of good health in order for them to avoid indulging in activities that will lead to physical or mental ill health. It should foster positive attitudes towards environmental development and conservation. It should lead the youth of Kenya to appreciate the need for a healthy environment.

ESSENCE STATEMENT

We live in a world of Mathematics whereby we count, add, subtract, multiply or divide quantities and substances throughout our daily interactions. Mathematics involves understanding numbers and the numerical operations used to develop strategies for mental mathematical problem-solving skills, estimation and computational fluency. We live in a world of space, shape and structures. It is impossible to think of a world without Mathematics. It is applied in the economic activities, scientific, social, religious and political worlds. It is therefore imperative that children are taught Mathematics from early years.

In Junior Secondary, Mathematics builds on the competencies acquired by the learner from primary school. It enhances the learner's competencies in mathematical skills as a foundation for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and other pathways at Senior School. Mathematics also prepares the learner to have sufficient skills and competencies for application in solving problems in real life situations. This is in line with vision 2030 and sessional paper number 1 of 2019 which emphasizes on STEM areas.

SUBJECT GENERAL LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the Junior Secondary School, the learner should be able to:

Demonstrate mastery of number concepts by working out problems in day to day life

Community Service Learning Class Activity

Community Service Learning (CSL) is an experiential learning strategy that integrates classroom learning and community service to enable learners reflect, experience and learn from the community. The CSL activity/project is expected to benefit the learner, the school and local community. Knowledge and skills on how to carry out a CSL activity/project has been covered in Life Skills Education (LSE).

All learners in Grade 7 will be expected to participate in a CSL class activity, which may be based on any strand or sub strand in Mathematics. The activity will give learners an opportunity to practise the CSL Project skills covered under LSE. This activity will be undertaken in groups or as whole for purposes of learning. Learners will be expected to apply knowledge and skills on steps of the CSL project to carry out the suggested activity as per the guidelines provided in the template. The learning approach will take the form of a whole school approach, where the entire school community will be engaged in the learning process. Teachers will guide learners to execute a simple school based integrated CSL class activity. This activity can be done in 1-2 weeks outside the classroom time.

CSL Skills to be developed:

Research: Learners will develop research skills as they investigate PCIs to address the activity, ways and tools to use in collecting the data, manner in which they will analyse information and present their findings.

Communication: Learners will develop effective communication skills as they engage with peers and school community members. These will include listening actively, asking questions, and presentation skills using varied modes.

Citizenship: Learners will be able to explore opportunities for engagement as members of the school community and providing a service for the common good.

Leadership: Learners develop leadership skills as they take up various roles within the CSL activity.

Financial Literacy Skills: Learners consider how they can undertake the project as well as sourcing and utilising resources effectively and efficiently.

Entrepreneurship: Learners consider ways of generating income through innovation for the CSL class activity.

APPENDIX 1: GUIDELINES FOR INTEGRATING CSL AT JUNIOR SCHOOL

Guidelines for Grade 7 Community Service-Learning Project Introduction

Community Service Learning (CSL) is an experiential learning strategy that integrates classroom learning and community service to enable learners reflect, experience and learn from the community. The CSL activity is hosted as a strand in Social Studies. The Social Studies teacher will be expected to coordinate teachers from other learning areas to carry out the integrated CSL class activity. Learners will be expected to apply knowledge, skills, attitudes and values from the different Learning Areas to undertake the integrated CSL class activity. Learners will undertake one common integrated class CSL activity following a 6-step milestone approach that is:

Assessment of CSL integrated Activity

Assessment for the integrated CSL activity will be conducted formatively. The assessment will consider both the process and end product. This entails assessing each of the milestone stages of the integrated CSL class activity. It will focus on 3 components namely: skills from various learning areas applied in carrying out the activity, core competencies developed and values nurtured.
