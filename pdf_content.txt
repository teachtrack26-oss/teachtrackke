What do a $500 billion e-commerce platform, a global ride-hailing service, and the
most popular streaming service on the planet have in common?
It’s the ability to build scalable systems.
This ability to scale ensures your system can handle increased loads without
sacrificing performance or user experience. Sure, not every system needs the scale
of Amazon, Uber, or Netflix. But scaling strategies can still help.
Here are eight must-know strategies to build scalable systems:

A stateless service is one that doesn’t retain information about client sessions between
requests. Each request contains all the information necessary for the server to process
it.
Stateless architecture makes scaling much easier because it allows servers to be
interchangeable and reduces the complexity of managing the state.

Ease of Scaling: Stateless services can easily be duplicated across multiple
servers.

Fault Tolerance: If a server fails, requests can be redirected to another server
without losing session data.
Use tokens like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to store session data on the client side
instead of the server.
For operations requiring state (e.g., shopping cart sessions), consider externalizing
state management to a database or caching layer like Redis.
Horizontal scaling, or "scale-out," involves adding more servers to share the load.
Unlike vertical scaling, which involves upgrading hardware, horizontal scaling is more
cost-effective and provides better fault tolerance.
Redundancy: Multiple servers reduce the impact of single points of failure.
Scalability: You can handle larger workloads by simply adding more servers.
Ensure your system supports distributed workloads. Tools like Kubernetes can
help manage containerized applications across multiple nodes.

Use stateless services to simplify horizontal scaling, as each server can
independently handle requests.
Load balancing involves distributing incoming requests evenly across multiple
servers. A load balancer acts as a middleman, ensuring that no single server is
overwhelmed.

Performance: Prevents overload by spreading the traffic evenly.
High Availability: Automatically redirects traffic to healthy servers in case of
failure.

Use hardware or software load balancers like NGINX, HAProxy, or AWS Elastic
Load Balancer.
Implement health checks to ensure that the load balancer only sends requests to
functioning servers.
Configure sticky sessions cautiously, as they can introduce statefulness and
reduce flexibility.
Auto-scaling dynamically adjusts the number of servers or resources based on real-
time traffic. It ensures you’re not over-provisioning during off-peak hours or under-
provisioning during traffic spikes.
4 - Auto Scaling

Cost Efficiency: Automatically scales down resources when demand decreases,
saving costs.

Traffic Management: Handles unexpected surges in traffic without manual
intervention.
Use cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, which offer built-in auto-
scaling tools.
Set clear thresholds for scaling up and down, based on CPU usage, memory, or
request latency.
Caching involves storing frequently accessed data closer to the user or in-memory
systems to reduce the load on the database. Proper caching can significantly improve
system performance and scalability.

Reduced Database Load: By serving repetitive queries from the cache, you reduce
the workload on your database.
Improved Speed: Cached data can be retrieved much faster than fetching it from
the database.

Use caching tools like Redis, Memcached, or Varnish.
Implement different caching layers:
Database Caching: Cache query results to avoid recalculating them.
Application Caching: Store data in memory for quick access.
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Cache static assets like images and
scripts close to the user.
Set appropriate expiration times to ensure cached data remains up-to-date.
Database replication involves creating multiple copies of your database across
different nodes. These replicas can handle read requests, improving both performance
and redundancy.

Scalable Reads: Multiple replicas can handle read-heavy workloads without
affecting the primary database.
Fault Tolerance: Provides backup nodes in case the primary database fails.

Use database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB, which support
replication.
Use asynchronous replication for better performance, but be aware of eventual
consistency issues.
Design your application to distinguish between read and write queries, sending
reads to replicas and writes to the primary node.
Sharding is the process of dividing your database into smaller, more manageable
pieces called shards. Each shard contains a subset of the data and operates
independently.

performance.

High Availability: Shards can be distributed across different regions for better
fault tolerance.
Use consistent hashing or range-based sharding to distribute data efficiently.
Plan your sharding strategy carefully, as it can be challenging to re-shard data
later.
Monitor shard performance and ensure balanced distribution to avoid hotspots.
Asynchronous processing moves resource-intensive tasks, such as sending emails or
generating reports, to background workers. This allows the system to handle new
requests without waiting for the completion of these tasks.

receiving a response.

Use message queues like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or AWS SQS to manage task queues.
Implement retry mechanisms to handle failures in background tasks.
Prioritize idempotency for tasks to ensure they can be retried safely without
duplication.

Thanks for the shoutout, Saurabh! There should be a 9th strategy: identifying when you need scaling
and writing faster backend code so you don't have to do it super early. Why? I've just encountered an
API endpoint that returns some data. The data is gathered with a for loop containing a SELECT query.
